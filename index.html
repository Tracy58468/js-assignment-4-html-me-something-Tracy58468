            <p>
               This is a very boring paragraph.
            </p>

            <p>No one said we had to be creative. This is good, because I'm not creative.</p>

            <p>No, indeed, I am not very creative at all.</p>
   
            <p>Oh, crap. We <em>do</em> have to be creative. "d. Demonstrates creativity. Donâ€™t stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!" But this doesn't mean the <em>copy</em> has to be creative. Oh, good!</p>

            <h2>Boring Part Number 2</h2>

            <p>Here are some HTML entities, at random, to show I know how to use them:  My knowledge of HTML is &lt; my knowledge of reading web pages. However, it's a small bit &gt; my knowledge of JavaScript. You might say, &quot;How 'bout them apples?&quot;, but does that really make sense in this context? I mean, what do apples &amp; oranges have to do with HTML? Ok, 'nuffa that.</p>

         <p>I recently chose an avatar for my LaunchCode stuff. I don't like showing my actual face (for privacy reasons), but I was tired of the default Slack avatar.</p>

         <p>I went to <a src="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a> and searched for "textures," then looked until I found something I liked.

         <p>That's enough for this article.</p>
